User-visible changes in ERTP:

## Release v0.1.0 (8/14/2019)

Core ERTP:
* Refactored contracts to make it easier for users to check the terms of
  a contract
* Added an IDL to describe the user-facing ERTP interface for mints,
  issuers, purses, payments, assays, and the contractHost.
* Renamed `getExclusive` and `getExclusiveAll` to `claim` and
  `claimAll`
* Added `equals` as an assay method

Pixel Demo:
* Created a new kind of rights for the pixel demo, in which rights are
  hierarchical and can be revoked by anyone higher in the hierarchy.
  This follows the pattern of owner, tenant, and subtenant
  relationships in real property. 
* Made the gallery in the pixel demo use a long-lived contract host
  rather than creating a new contract host for each contract

## Release v0.0.9 (7/29/2019)

* Moved ERTP from the SwingSet repository
* Added pixel demo and handoff table to push ERTP design forward to
  non-fungible tokens with real uses
