# ERTP - Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol

Bitcoin has unspent transactions. Ethereum has account balances. Agoric
has ERTP. 

ERTP is a uniform way of transferring tokens and other digital
assets in JavaScript. All kinds of digital assets can be easily
created, but importantly, they can be transferred in exactly the same
ways, with exactly the same security properties. 

## A quick tutorial

Let's look at an example. In ERTP, all digital assets, including fungible and
non-fungible tokens, are created by a `mint`. Having access to the mint
gives you the power to create more digital assets of the same type at
will. For instance, let's say we want to create a new community
currency called 'BaytownBucks':

```js
const baytownBucksMint = makeMint('BaytownBucks');
```

Great! Now let's use our mint to create 1000 new BaytownBucks.

```js
const purse = baytownBucksMint.mint(1000, 'community treasury');
```

The act of minting created 1000 BaytownBucks and stored them together in a
`purse`. Purses in ERTP only hold one type of digital asset, so this
purse can only ever hold BaytownBucks.

Let's distribute the BaytownBucks to members of the community. To send
money in ERTP, we withdraw `payments` from purses. 

```js
const paymentForAlice = purse.withdraw(10, `alice's community money`);
```

Like our purse, this payment contains BaytownBucks, but unlike purses,
payments are used to represent tokens in transit. A payment can be
sent to someone else, a purse never should be. 

Now let's send the payment to Alice as message:

```
alice.receivePayment(paymentForAlice);
```

This may seem strange, but ERTP is built on top of [an
infrastructure](https://github.com/Agoric/SwingSet) in which
everything is an object. In this example, we have a reference to the
object `alice`, and can call her `receivePayment` method to send her a
payment. Alice's methods are entirely up to her, and are not part of
ERTP.

## Security Properties

How does Alice know that she got paid real money? She could have been
sent fake money, or she could have been sent money that was
[double-spent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending). 

When alice receives an alleged payment, she can call a method to know
that the payment is 1) valid, and 2) exclusively hers:

```js
const myExclusivePayment = BaytownBucksIssuer.claimAll(allegedPayment);
```

The BaytownBucksIssuer is associated with the BaytownBucksMint, but
the issuer is the public-facing version that is accessible to anyone.
By holding the reference to a mint, you can mint more tokens. By
holding a reference to the issuer for a mint, you can check that a
payment is valid and exclusively claim it for yourself. 

That's the basic use case for a fungible token. `makeMint` in
[issuers.js](core/issuers.js) takes
in an optional configuration that allows for many more possibilities. 

## Pixel Gallery Demo

To explore further types of digital assets, beyond fungible tokens, we
decided to create a demo for our
[testnet](https://github.com/Agoric/cosmic-swingset) in which users
can buy and sell the right to color a pixel on a webpage. Read more
[here](/GALLERY-README.md).

## Gotchas

When looking at the code in our [tests](test), you might see some new
concepts:

* __Vats__: All user code runs in what we call a `vat`. Within a vat,
  code is run synchronously. Communication with another vat happens
  asynchronously. The [SwingSet
  infrastructure](https://github.com/Agoric/SwingSet) creates the vats
  and makes communication between vats possible. 

* __E() and infix bang (!)__: With our Swingset infrastructure, we can
  talk to objects in another vat as if they were local, which is
  really cool! In order to do so, we need something more than the
  "dot" syntax. So instead of `obj.foo()`, we either do `E(obj).foo()` or
  the syntactic sugar, `obj!foo()`.

* __Presences__: Presences are our name for the local object that
  stands in for the remote object. So when we say `obj!foo()`, `obj`
  is a presence because it represents a remote object that the message
  `foo` will be passed to.

Mark Miller explained ERTP on Oct 10, 2018 in his [Programming Secure Smart Contracts][watch] presentation
during San Francisco Blockchain Week at a
[SF Cryptocurrency Devs meetup](https://www.meetup.com/SF-Cryptocurrency-Devs/events/253457222/).

## Install and Test

Note node >= 11.0 is required.

```
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

## Higher Order Smart Contracts

The `contractHost` tests detail the composition of a covered call option
with an escrow exchange contract.

```
npx tape -r esm test/swingsetTests/contractHost/test-contractHost.js
```

For more examples, please see the code for Alice and Bob in `test/swingsetTests/contractHost/`.
