/**
 * `isOfferSafeForOffer` checks offer safety for a single offer.
 *
 * Note: This implementation checks whether we refund for all rules or
 * return winnings for all rules. It does not allow some refunds and
 * some winnings, which is what would happen if you checked the rules
 * independently. It *does* allow for returning a full refund plus
 * full winnings.
 *
 * @param  {extentOps[]} extentOpsArray - an array of extentOps
 * ordered in the same order as the corresponding assays
 * @param  {payoutRule[]} payoutRules - the rules that accompanied the
 * escrow of payments that dictate what the user expected to get back
 * from Zoe. The payoutRules are an array of objects that have a kind
 * and units, in the same order as the corresponding assays. The
 * offerRules, including the payoutRules, are a player's understanding
 * of the contract that they are entering when they make an offer.
 * A payoutRule is structured in the form `{ kind:
 * descriptionString, units}`
 * @param  {extent[]} extents - an array of extents ordered in the
 * same order as the corresponding assays. This array of extents is
 * the reallocation to be given to a player.
