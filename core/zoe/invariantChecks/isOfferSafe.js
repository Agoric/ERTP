 * from Zoe. The payoutRules are an array of objects that have a kind
 * and units, in the same order as the corresponding assays. The
 * offerRules, including the payoutRules, are a player's understanding
 * of the contract that they are entering when they make an offer. A
 * payoutRule is structured in the form `{ kind: descriptionString,
